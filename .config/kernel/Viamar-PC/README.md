    <summary>linux-6.16.8</summary>
        <br>
            Last kernel config I made, based on the default Arch Linux config for x86_64 architecture.
            It is optimized for my hardware and use case, which is a desktop PC with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600G CPU, 32GB of RAM.
            I can't made AMDGPU build-in, but I will try to do it in the next kernel version.
